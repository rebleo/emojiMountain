# emojiMountain
a landscape twitter bot
[@emojiMt](http://www.twitter.com/emojiMountain)

This bot searches the Twitter API for a user phrase ('mountain', 'ðŸ—»' or 'ðŸŒŠ' and tweets a random emoji mountain named for the user the image is in response to. There are some bugs but that's okay.

Made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Twit] (https://github.com/ttezel/twit) & all the help & fun w/ [Dan Shiffman]
